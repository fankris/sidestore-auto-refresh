"""Coverage for catalog request failure classification and propagation.

The physical defect this file locks down: a source from issue #38 could be
added and appeared in Sources, but opening it failed with "SideStore could not
start or complete the requested action", which is the generic command-stage
message. That message is produced on both sides of the boundary:
- host: V3ServiceBridge minted stage=.command for unavailable, XPC, busy,
  timeout and invalid-response failures;
- service: the catalog Core Data read already had a typed failure, but a
  pre-query rejection returned an idless token.

Rules enforced here:
- A catalog request keeps its operation context on both sides of the boundary.
- Each boundary gets its own typed classification instead of a generic message.
- The source manifest is never blamed unless manifest parsing actually failed.
- Diagnostics are privacy-safe: no source identifier, URL, app names, bundle
  identifiers, credentials, pairing records, or filesystem paths.
